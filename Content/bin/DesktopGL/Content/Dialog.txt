GARY: &wDon't worry Steve, &wI got you! &w&nIt's good to see you again. 
GARY: &w&wBy the way, &w&ndo you know what happened to Rosetta? &w&nI think I saw her being launched south&w.&w.&w.

GARY: &wI don't think I can break this barrier&w.&w.&w.
GARY: &wThe door doesn't seem to budge. &w&nI think I need a key to open it&w.&w.&w.
HUNTER ALIEN: &wGrrrr&w.&w.&w.&w. &w&nYou will not make it past our lord A.L.I.E.N.!
ROSETTA: &wGary! &wSteve! &w&nI'm so glad to see you both again!
GARY: &wRosetta! &w&nIt's good to see that you're safe. 
ROSETTA: &wI was held captive the entire time, &w&njust like Steve, &w&nbut luckily you guys saved me.
GARY: &wNow that I think about it, &w&nI think there was a magic barrier &nto the east. 
GARY: &wDo you think you might be able to &ndo something about it?
ROSETTA: &wThat shouldn't be a problem for me! &w&nI know some of the best magic, &w&nso surely I can destroy a barrier like that.
GARY: &wNice! &w&nLet's go then!
&wRosetta has joined the party! &w&nWith her magic, &w&nyou might be able to break certain things&w.&w.&w.
